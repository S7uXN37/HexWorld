# HexWorld
A Unity 2018.3.6f1 Script to generate hexagonal maps from Hexagon Prefabs

Includes the Script and an example prefab + Scene. To get started, create a new Project called HexWorld and overwrite the project files with the repository content.

I'm not maintaining it, but maybe this can be useful to someone.
